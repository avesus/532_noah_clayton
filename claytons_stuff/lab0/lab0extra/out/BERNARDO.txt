1 Who's there?
3 Long live the king!
5 He.
7 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
10 Have you had quiet guard?
12 Well, good night.
13 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
14 The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
24 Say,
25 What, is Horatio there?
27 Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
29 I have seen nothing.
38 Sit down awhile;
39 And let us once again assail your ears,
40 That are so fortified against our story
41 What we have two nights seen.
44 Last night of all,
45 When yond same star that's westward from the pole
46 Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
47 Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
48 The bell then beating one,--
50 In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
52 Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
54 It would be spoke to.
61                   See, it stalks away!
64 How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
65 Is not this something more than fantasy?
66 What think you on't?
121 I think it be no other but e'en so:
122 Well may it sort that this portentous figure
123 Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
124 That was and is the question of these wars.
154 'Tis here!
161 It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
