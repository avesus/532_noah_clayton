3286 Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
3287 wilfully seeks her own salvation?
3291 How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
3292 own defence?
3294 It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
3295 here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,
3296 it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
3297 is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
3298 herself wittingly.
3300 Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
3301 stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
3302 and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
3303 goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
3304 and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
3305 that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
3307 Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
3311 Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
3312 great folk should have countenance in this world to
3313 drown or hang themselves, more than their even
3314 Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
3315 gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
3316 they hold up Adam's profession.
3318 He was the first that ever bore arms.
3320 What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
3321 Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
3322 could he dig without arms? I'll put another
3323 question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
3324 purpose, confess thyself--
3326 What is he that builds stronger than either the
3327 mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
3330 I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
3331 does well; but how does it well? it does well to
3332 those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
3333 gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
3334 the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
3337 Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
3339 To't.
3341 Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
3342 ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
3343 you are asked this question next, say 'a
3344 grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
3345 doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
3346 stoup of liquor.
3352 [Sings]
3353 But age, with his stealing steps,
3354 Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
3355 And hath shipped me intil the land,
3356 As if I had never been such.
3374 [Sings]
3375 A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
3376 For and a shrouding sheet:
3377 O, a pit of clay for to be made
3378 For such a guest is meet.
3400 Mine, sir.
3401 O, a pit of clay for to be made
3402 For such a guest is meet.
3404 You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
3405 yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
3408 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
3409 you.
3411 For no man, sir.
3413 For none, neither.
3415 One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
3423 Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
3424 that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
3426 Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
3427 was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
3428 is mad, and sent into England.
3430 Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
3431 there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
3433 'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
3434 are as mad as he.
3436 Very strangely, they say.
3438 Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
3440 Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
3441 and boy, thirty years.
3443 I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
3444 have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
3445 hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
3446 or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
3448 Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
3449 he will keep out water a great while; and your water
3450 is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
3451 Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
3452 three and twenty years.
3454 A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
3456 A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
3457 flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
3458 sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
3460 E'en that.
