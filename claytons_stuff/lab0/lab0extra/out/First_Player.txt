1491 What speech, my lord?
1527 'Anon he finds him
1528 Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
1529 Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
1530 Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
1531 Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
1532 But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
1533 The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
1534 Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
1535 Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
1536 Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
1537 Which was declining on the milky head
1538 Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
1539 So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
1540 And like a neutral to his will and matter,
1541 Did nothing.
1542 But, as we often see, against some storm,
1543 A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
1544 The bold winds speechless and the orb below
1545 As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
1546 Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
1547 Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
1548 And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
1549 On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
1550 With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
1551 Now falls on Priam.
1552 Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
1553 In general synod 'take away her power;
1554 Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
1555 And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
1556 As low as to the fiends!'
1561 'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
1564 'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
1565 With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
1566 Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
1567 About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
1568 A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
1569 Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
1570 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
1571 pronounced:
1572 But if the gods themselves did see her then
1573 When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
1574 In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
1575 The instant burst of clamour that she made,
1576 Unless things mortal move them not at all,
1577 Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
1578 And passion in the gods.'
1597 Ay, my lord.
1601 Ay, my lord.
1884 I warrant your honour.
1905 I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
1906 sir.
