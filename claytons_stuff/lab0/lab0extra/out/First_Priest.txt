3505 Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
3506 As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
3507 And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
3508 She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
3509 Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
3510 Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
3511 Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
3512 Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
3513 Of bell and burial.
3515 No more be done:
3516 We should profane the service of the dead
3517 To sing a requiem and such rest to her
3518 As to peace-parted souls.
