1082                   But we both obey,
1083 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
1084 To lay our service freely at your feet,
1085 To be commanded.
1091 Heavens make our presence and our practises
1092 Pleasant and helpful to him!
1287 My honoured lord!
1292 Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
1293 On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
1298 'Faith, her privates we.
1306 Prison, my lord!
1320 Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
1321 substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
1340 What should we say, my lord?
1355 My lord, we were sent for.
1419 O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
1428 There are the players.
1436 In what, my dear lord?
1673 Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
1674 But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
1675 When we would bring him on to some confession
1676 Of his true state.
1679 But with much forcing of his disposition.
2158 Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
2160 The king, sir,--
2162 Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
2164 No, my lord, rather with choler.
2169 Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
2170 start not so wildly from my affair.
2172 The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
2173 spirit, hath sent me to you.
2175 Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
2176 breed. If it shall please you to make me a
2177 wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
2178 commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
2179 shall be the end of my business.
2181 What, my lord?
2208 O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
2209 unmannerly.
2212 My lord, I cannot.
2214 Believe me, I cannot.
2216 I know no touch of it, my lord.
2221 But these cannot I command to any utterance of
2222 harmony; I have not the skill.
2266 We will ourselves provide:
2267 Most holy and religious fear it is
2268 To keep those many many bodies safe
2269 That live and feed upon your majesty.
2666 A thing, my lord!
