2810 She is importunate, indeed distract:
2811 Her mood will needs be pitied.
2813 She speaks much of her father; says she hears
2814 There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
2815 Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
2816 That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
2817 Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
2818 The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
2819 And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
2820 Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
2821 yield them,
2822 Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
2823 Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
2910 Save yourself, my lord:
2911 The ocean, overpeering of his list,
2912 Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
2913 Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
2914 O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
2915 And, as the world were now but to begin,
2916 Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
2917 The ratifiers and props of every word,
2918 They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
2919 Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
2920 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
