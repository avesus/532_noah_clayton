711 Mark me.
713                   My hour is almost come,
714 When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
715 Must render up myself.
717 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
718 To what I shall unfold.
720  So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
722 I am thy father's spirit,
723 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
724 And for the day confined to fast in fires,
725 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
726 Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
727 To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
728 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
729 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
730 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
731 Thy knotted and combined locks to part
732 And each particular hair to stand on end,
733 Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
734 But this eternal blazon must not be
735 To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
736 If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
738 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
740 Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
741 But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
745 I find thee apt;
746 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
747 That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
748 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
749 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
750 A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
751 Is by a forged process of my death
752 Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
753 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
754 Now wears his crown.
756 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
757 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
758 O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
759 So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
760 The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
761 O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
762 From me, whose love was of that dignity
763 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
764 I made to her in marriage, and to decline
765 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
766 To those of mine!
767 But virtue, as it never will be moved,
768 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
769 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
770 Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
771 And prey on garbage.
772 But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
773 Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
774 My custom always of the afternoon,
775 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
776 With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
777 And in the porches of my ears did pour
778 The leperous distilment; whose effect
779 Holds such an enmity with blood of man
780 That swift as quicksilver it courses through
781 The natural gates and alleys of the body,
782 And with a sudden vigour doth posset
783 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
784 The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
785 And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
786 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
787 All my smooth body.
788 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
789 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
790 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
791 Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
792 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
793 With all my imperfections on my head:
794 O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
795 If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
796 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
797 A couch for luxury and damned incest.
798 But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
799 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
800 Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
801 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
802 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
803 The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
804 And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
805 Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
878 [Beneath]  Swear.
886 [Beneath]  Swear.
892 [Beneath]  Swear.
911 [Beneath]  Swear.
2482 Do not forget: this visitation
2483 Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
2484 But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
2485 O, step between her and her fighting soul:
2486 Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
2487 Speak to her, Hamlet.
