256 [Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
258 Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
265 Ay, madam, it is common.
268 Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
269 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
270 Nor customary suits of solemn black,
271 Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
272 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
273 Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
274 Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
275 That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
276 For they are actions that a man might play:
277 But I have that within which passeth show;
278 These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
312 I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
321 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
322 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
323 Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
324 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
325 How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
326 Seem to me all the uses of this world!
327 Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
328 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
329 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
330 But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
331 So excellent a king; that was, to this,
332 Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
333 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
334 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
335 Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
336 As if increase of appetite had grown
337 By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
338 Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
339 A little month, or ere those shoes were old
340 With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
341 Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
342 O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
343 Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
344 My father's brother, but no more like my father
345 Than I to Hercules: within a month:
346 Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
347 Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
348 She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
349 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
350 It is not nor it cannot come to good:
351 But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
353 I am glad to see you well:
354 Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
356 Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
357 And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
359 I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
360 But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
362 I would not hear your enemy say so,
363 Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
364 To make it truster of your own report
365 Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
366 But what is your affair in Elsinore?
367 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
369 I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
370 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
372 Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
373 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
374 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
375 Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
376 My father!--methinks I see my father.
378                   In my mind's eye, Horatio.
380 He was a man, take him for all in all,
381 I shall not look upon his like again.
383 Saw? who?
385 The king my father!
390 For God's love, let me hear.
408 But where was this?
410 Did you not speak to it?
418 'Tis very strange.
422 Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
423 Hold you the watch to-night?
426 Arm'd, say you?
429 From top to toe?
432 Then saw you not his face?
434 What, look'd he frowningly?
436 Pale or red?
438                   And fix'd his eyes upon you?
440                   I would I had been there.
442 Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
447                   His beard was grizzled--no?
450                   I will watch to-night;
451 Perchance 'twill walk again.
453 If it assume my noble father's person,
454 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
455 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
456 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
457 Let it be tenable in your silence still;
458 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
459 Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
460 I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
461 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
462 I'll visit you.
464 Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
465 My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
466 I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
467 Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
468 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
609 The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
611 What hour now?
613 No, it is struck.
617 The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
618 Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
619 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
620 The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
621 The triumph of his pledge.
623 Ay, marry, is't:
624 But to my mind, though I am native here
625 And to the manner born, it is a custom
626 More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
627 This heavy-headed revel east and west
628 Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
629 They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
630 Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
631 From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
632 The pith and marrow of our attribute.
633 So, oft it chances in particular men,
634 That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
635 As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
636 Since nature cannot choose his origin--
637 By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
638 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
639 Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
640 The form of plausive manners, that these men,
641 Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
642 Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
643 Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
644 As infinite as man may undergo--
645 Shall in the general censure take corruption
646 From that particular fault: the dram of eale
647 Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
648 To his own scandal.
650 Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
651 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
652 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
653 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
654 Thou comest in such a questionable shape
655 That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
656 King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
657 Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
658 Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
659 Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
660 Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
661 Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
662 To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
663 That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
664 Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
665 Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
666 So horridly to shake our disposition
667 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
668 Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
676 It will not speak; then I will follow it.
678                   Why, what should be the fear?
679 I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
680 And for my soul, what can it do to that,
681 Being a thing immortal as itself?
682 It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
693 It waves me still.
694 Go on; I'll follow thee.
696 Hold off your hands.
698 My fate cries out,
699 And makes each petty artery in this body
700 As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
701 Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
702 By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
703 I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
710 Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
712        I will.
716 Alas, poor ghost!
719 Speak; I am bound to hear.
721 What?
737 O God!
739 Murder!
742 Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
743 As meditation or the thoughts of love,
744 May sweep to my revenge.
755 O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
806 O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
807 And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
808 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
809 But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
810 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
811 In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
812 Yea, from the table of my memory
813 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
814 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
815 That youth and observation copied there;
816 And thy commandment all alone shall live
817 Within the book and volume of my brain,
818 Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
819 O most pernicious woman!
820 O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
821 My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
822 That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
823 At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
824 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
825 It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
826 I have sworn 't.
831 So be it!
833 Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
836 O, wonderful!
838 No; you'll reveal it.
841 How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
842 But you'll be secret?
845 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
846 But he's an arrant knave.
849                   Why, right; you are i' the right;
850 And so, without more circumstance at all,
851 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
852 You, as your business and desire shall point you;
853 For every man has business and desire,
854 Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
855 Look you, I'll go pray.
857 I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
858 Yes, 'faith heartily.
860 Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
861 And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
862 It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
863 For your desire to know what is between us,
864 O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
865 As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
866 Give me one poor request.
868 Never make known what you have seen to-night.
871 Nay, but swear't.
875 Upon my sword.
877 Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
879 Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
880 truepenny?
881 Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
882 Consent to swear.
884 Never to speak of this that you have seen,
885 Swear by my sword.
887 Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
888 Come hither, gentlemen,
889 And lay your hands again upon my sword:
890 Never to speak of this that you have heard,
891 Swear by my sword.
893 Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
894 A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
896 And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
897 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
898 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
899 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
900 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
901 As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
902 To put an antic disposition on,
903 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
904 With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
905 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
906 As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
907 Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
908 Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
909 That you know aught of me: this not to do,
910 So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
912 Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
913 So, gentlemen,
914 With all my love I do commend me to you:
915 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
916 May do, to express his love and friending to you,
917 God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
918 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
919 The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
920 That ever I was born to set it right!
921 Nay, come, let's go together.
1236 Well, God-a-mercy.
1238 Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
1240 Then I would you were so honest a man.
1242 Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
1243 one man picked out of ten thousand.
1245 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
1246 god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
1248 Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
1249 blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
1250 Friend, look to 't.
1257 Words, words, words.
1259 Between who?
1261 Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
1262 that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
1263 wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
1264 plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
1265 wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
1266 though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
1267 I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
1268 yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
1269 you could go backward.
1272 Into my grave.
1280 You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
1281 more willingly part withal: except my life, except
1282 my life, except my life.
1284 These tedious old fools!
1289 My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
1290 Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
1294 Nor the soles of her shoe?
1296 Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
1297 her favours?
1299 In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
1300 is a strumpet. What's the news?
1302 Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
1303 Let me question more in particular: what have you,
1304 my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
1305 that she sends you to prison hither?
1307 Denmark's a prison.
1309 A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
1310 wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
1312 Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
1313 either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
1314 it is a prison.
1317 O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
1318 myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
1319 have bad dreams.
1322 A dream itself is but a shadow.
1325 Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
1326 outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
1327 to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
1330 No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
1331 of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
1332 man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
1333 beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
1335 Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
1336 thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
1337 too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
1338 your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
1339 deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
1341 Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
1342 for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
1343 which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
1344 I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
1346 That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
1347 the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
1348 our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
1349 love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
1350 charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
1351 whether you were sent for, or no?
1353 [Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
1354 love me, hold not off.
1356 I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
1357 prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
1358 and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
1359 wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
1360 custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
1361 with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
1362 earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
1363 excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
1364 o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
1365 with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
1366 me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
1367 What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
1368 how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
1369 express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
1370 in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
1371 world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
1372 what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
1373 me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
1374 you seem to say so.
1376 Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
1381 He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
1382 shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
1383 shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
1384 sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
1385 in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
1386 lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
1387 say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
1388 for't. What players are they?
1391 How chances it they travel? their residence, both
1392 in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
1395 Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
1396 in the city? are they so followed?
1398 How comes it? do they grow rusty?
1406 What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
1407 they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
1408 longer than they can sing? will they not say
1409 afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
1410 players--as it is most like, if their means are no
1411 better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
1412 exclaim against their own succession?
1418 Is't possible?
1420 Do the boys carry it away?
1422 It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
1423 Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
1424 my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
1425 hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
1426 'Sblood, there is something in this more than
1427 natural, if philosophy could find it out.
1429 Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
1430 come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
1431 and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
1432 lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
1433 must show fairly outward, should more appear like
1434 entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
1435 uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
1437 I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
1438 southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
1440 Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
1441 hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
1442 out of his swaddling-clouts.
1445 I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
1446 mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
1447 'twas so indeed.
1449 My lord, I have news to tell you.
1450 When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
1452 Buz, buz!
1454 Then came each actor on his ass,--
1462 O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
1464 Why,
1465 'One fair daughter and no more,
1466 The which he loved passing well.'
1468 Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
1471 Nay, that follows not.
1473 Why,
1474 'As by lot, God wot,'
1475 and then, you know,
1476 'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
1477 the first row of the pious chanson will show you
1478 more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
1479 You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
1480 to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
1481 friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
1482 comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
1483 lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
1484 nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
1485 altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
1486 apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
1487 ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
1488 to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
1489 we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
1490 of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
1492 I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
1493 never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
1494 play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
1495 caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
1496 it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
1497 cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
1498 digested in the scenes, set down with as much
1499 modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
1500 were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
1501 savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
1502 indict the author of affectation; but called it an
1503 honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
1504 much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
1505 chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
1506 thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
1507 Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
1508 at this line: let me see, let me see--
1509 'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
1510 it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
1511 'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
1512 Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
1513 When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
1514 Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
1515 With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
1516 Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
1517 With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
1518 Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
1519 That lend a tyrannous and damned light
1520 To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
1521 And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
1522 With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
1523 Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
1524 So, proceed you.
1558 It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
1559 say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
1560 sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
1562 'The mobled queen?'
1581 'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
1582 Good my lord, will you see the players well
1583 bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
1584 they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
1585 time: after your death you were better have a bad
1586 epitaph than their ill report while you live.
1588 God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
1589 after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
1590 Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
1591 they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
1592 Take them in.
1594 Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
1595 Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
1596 Murder of Gonzago?
1598 We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
1599 study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
1600 I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
1602 Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
1603 not.
1604 My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
1605 welcome to Elsinore.
1607 Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
1608 Now I am alone.
1609 O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
1610 Is it not monstrous that this player here,
1611 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
1612 Could force his soul so to his own conceit
1613 That from her working all his visage wann'd,
1614 Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
1615 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
1616 With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
1617 For Hecuba!
1618 What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
1619 That he should weep for her? What would he do,
1620 Had he the motive and the cue for passion
1621 That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
1622 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
1623 Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
1624 Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
1625 The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
1626 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
1627 Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
1628 And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
1629 Upon whose property and most dear life
1630 A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
1631 Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
1632 Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
1633 Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
1634 As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
1635 Ha!
1636 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
1637 But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
1638 To make oppression bitter, or ere this
1639 I should have fatted all the region kites
1640 With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
1641 Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
1642 O, vengeance!
1643 Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
1644 That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
1645 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
1646 Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
1647 And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
1648 A scullion!
1649 Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
1650 That guilty creatures sitting at a play
1651 Have by the very cunning of the scene
1652 Been struck so to the soul that presently
1653 They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
1654 For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
1655 With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
1656 Play something like the murder of my father
1657 Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
1658 I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
1659 I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
1660 May be the devil: and the devil hath power
1661 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
1662 Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
1663 As he is very potent with such spirits,
1664 Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
1665 More relative than this: the play 's the thing
1666 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
1730 To be, or not to be, that is the question,
1731 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
1732 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
1733 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
1734 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
1735 No more; and by a sleep to say we end
1736 The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
1737 That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
1738 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
1739 To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
1740 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
1741 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
1742 Must give us pause: there's the respect
1743 That makes calamity of so long life;
1744 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
1745 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
1746 The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
1747 The insolence of office and the spurns
1748 That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
1749 When he himself might his quietus make
1750 With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
1751 To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
1752 But that the dread of something after death,
1753 The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
1754 No traveller returns, puzzles the will
1755 And makes us rather bear those ills we have
1756 Than fly to others that we know not of?
1757 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
1758 And thus the native hue of resolution
1759 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
1760 And enterprises of great pith and moment
1761 With this regard their currents turn awry,
1762 And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
1763 The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
1764 Be all my sins remember'd.
1767 I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
1771 No, not I;
1772 I never gave you aught.
1779 Ha, ha! are you honest?
1781 Are you fair?
1783 That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
1784 admit no discourse to your beauty.
1787 Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
1788 transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
1789 force of honesty can translate beauty into his
1790 likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
1791 time gives it proof. I did love you once.
1793 You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
1794 so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
1795 it: I loved you not.
1797 Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
1798 breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
1799 but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
1800 were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
1801 proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
1802 my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
1803 imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
1804 in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
1805 between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
1806 all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
1807 Where's your father?
1809 Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
1810 fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
1812 If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
1813 thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
1814 snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
1815 nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
1816 marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
1817 what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
1818 and quickly too. Farewell.
1820 I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
1821 has given you one face, and you make yourselves
1822 another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
1823 nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
1824 your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
1825 made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
1826 those that are married already, all but one, shall
1827 live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
1828 nunnery, go.
1869 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
1870 you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
1871 as many of your players do, I had as lief the
1872 town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
1873 too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
1874 for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
1875 the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
1876 a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
1877 offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
1878 periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
1879 very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
1880 for the most part are capable of nothing but
1881 inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
1882 a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
1883 out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
1885 Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
1886 be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
1887 word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
1888 the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
1889 from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
1890 first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
1891 mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
1892 scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
1893 the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
1894 or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
1895 laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
1896 censure of the which one must in your allowance
1897 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
1898 players that I have seen play, and heard others
1899 praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
1900 that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
1901 the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
1902 strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
1903 nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
1904 well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
1907 O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
1908 your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
1909 for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
1910 set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
1911 too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
1912 question of the play be then to be considered:
1913 that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
1914 in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
1916 Bid the players make haste.
1917 Will you two help to hasten them?
1920 What ho! Horatio!
1922 Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
1923 As e'er my conversation coped withal.
1925                   Nay, do not think I flatter;
1926 For what advancement may I hope from thee
1927 That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
1928 To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
1929 No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
1930 And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
1931 Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
1932 Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
1933 And could of men distinguish, her election
1934 Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
1935 As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
1936 A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
1937 Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
1938 Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
1939 That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
1940 To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
1941 That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
1942 In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
1943 As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
1944 There is a play to-night before the king;
1945 One scene of it comes near the circumstance
1946 Which I have told thee of my father's death:
1947 I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
1948 Even with the very comment of thy soul
1949 Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
1950 Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
1951 It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
1952 And my imaginations are as foul
1953 As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
1954 For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
1955 And after we will both our judgments join
1956 In censure of his seeming.
1960 They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
1961 Get you a place.
1963 Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
1964 the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
1967 No, nor mine now.
1968 My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
1970 What did you enact?
1973 It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
1974 there. Be the players ready?
1977 No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
1979 Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
1981 I mean, my head upon your lap?
1983 Do you think I meant country matters?
1985 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
1987 Nothing.
1989 Who, I?
1991 O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
1992 but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
1993 mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
1995 So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
1996 I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
1997 months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
1998 hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
1999 a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
2000 then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
2001 the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
2002 the hobby-horse is forgot.'
2004 Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
2006 We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
2007 keep counsel; they'll tell all.
2009 Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
2010 ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
2015 Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
2017 As woman's love.
2045 [Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.
2088 If she should break it now!
2094 Madam, how like you this play?
2096 O, but she'll keep her word.
2098 No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
2099 i' the world.
2101 The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
2102 is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
2103 the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
2104 anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
2105 that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
2106 touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
2107 withers are unwrung.
2108 This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
2110 I could interpret between you and your love, if I
2111 could see the puppets dallying.
2113 It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
2115 So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
2116 pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
2117 'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
2124 He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
2125 name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
2126 choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
2127 gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
2129 What, frighted with false fire!
2134      Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
2135 The hart ungalled play;
2136 For some must watch, while some must sleep:
2137 So runs the world away.
2138 Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
2139 the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
2140 Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
2141 fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
2143 A whole one, I.
2144 For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
2145 This realm dismantled was
2146 Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
2147 A very, very--pajock.
2149 O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
2150 thousand pound. Didst perceive?
2152 Upon the talk of the poisoning?
2154 Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
2155 For if the king like not the comedy,
2156 Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
2157 Come, some music!
2159 Sir, a whole history.
2161 Ay, sir, what of him?
2163 With drink, sir?
2165 Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
2166 signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
2167 to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
2168 more choler.
2171 I am tame, sir: pronounce.
2174 You are welcome.
2180 Sir, I cannot.
2182 Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
2183 sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
2184 or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
2185 more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
2188 O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
2189 is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
2190 admiration? Impart.
2193 We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
2194 you any further trade with us?
2196 So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
2200 Sir, I lack advancement.
2203 Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
2204 is something musty.
2205 O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
2206 you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
2207 as if you would drive me into a toil?
2210 I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
2211 this pipe?
2213 I pray you.
2215 I do beseech you.
2217 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
2218 your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
2219 mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
2220 Look you, these are the stops.
2223 Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
2224 me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
2225 my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
2226 mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
2227 the top of my compass: and there is much music,
2228 excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
2229 you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
2230 easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
2231 instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
2232 cannot play upon me.
2233 God bless you, sir!
2236 Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
2238 Methinks it is like a weasel.
2240 Or like a whale?
2242 Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
2243 me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
2245 By and by is easily said.
2246 Leave me, friends.
2247 Tis now the very witching time of night,
2248 When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
2249 Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
2250 And do such bitter business as the day
2251 Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
2252 O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
2253 The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
2254 Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
2255 I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
2256 My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
2257 How in my words soever she be shent,
2258 To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
2335 Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
2336 And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
2337 And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
2338 A villain kills my father; and for that,
2339 I, his sole son, do this same villain send
2340 To heaven.
2341 O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
2342 He took my father grossly, full of bread;
2343 With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
2344 And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
2345 But in our circumstance and course of thought,
2346 'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
2347 To take him in the purging of his soul,
2348 When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
2349 No!
2350 Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
2351 When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
2352 Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
2353 At gaming, swearing, or about some act
2354 That has no relish of salvation in't;
2355 Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
2356 And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
2357 As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
2358 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
2366 [Within]  Mother, mother, mother!
2369 Now, mother, what's the matter?
2371 Mother, you have my father much offended.
2373 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
2375 What's the matter now?
2377 No, by the rood, not so:
2378 You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
2379 And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
2381 Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
2382 You go not till I set you up a glass
2383 Where you may see the inmost part of you.
2387 [Drawing]  How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
2390 Nay, I know not:
2391 Is it the king?
2393 A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
2394 As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
2396                   Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
2397 Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
2398 I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
2399 Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
2400 Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
2401 And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
2402 If it be made of penetrable stuff,
2403 If damned custom have not brass'd it so
2404 That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
2407 Such an act
2408 That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
2409 Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
2410 From the fair forehead of an innocent love
2411 And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
2412 As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
2413 As from the body of contraction plucks
2414 The very soul, and sweet religion makes
2415 A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
2416 Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
2417 With tristful visage, as against the doom,
2418 Is thought-sick at the act.
2421 Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
2422 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
2423 See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
2424 Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
2425 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
2426 A station like the herald Mercury
2427 New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
2428 A combination and a form indeed,
2429 Where every god did seem to set his seal,
2430 To give the world assurance of a man:
2431 This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
2432 Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
2433 Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
2434 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
2435 And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
2436 You cannot call it love; for at your age
2437 The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
2438 And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
2439 Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
2440 Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
2441 Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
2442 Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
2443 But it reserved some quantity of choice,
2444 To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
2445 That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
2446 Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
2447 Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
2448 Or but a sickly part of one true sense
2449 Could not so mope.
2450 O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
2451 If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
2452 To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
2453 And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
2454 When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
2455 Since frost itself as actively doth burn
2456 And reason panders will.
2461 Nay, but to live
2462 In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
2463 Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
2464 Over the nasty sty,--
2468 A murderer and a villain;
2469 A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
2470 Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
2471 A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
2472 That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
2473 And put it in his pocket!
2475 A king of shreds and patches,--
2476 Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
2477 You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
2479 Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
2480 That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
2481 The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
2488 How is it with you, lady?
2498 On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
2499 His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
2500 Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
2501 Lest with this piteous action you convert
2502 My stern effects: then what I have to do
2503 Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
2505 Do you see nothing there?
2507 Nor did you nothing hear?
2509 Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
2510 My father, in his habit as he lived!
2511 Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
2515 Ecstasy!
2516 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
2517 And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
2518 That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
2519 And I the matter will re-word; which madness
2520 Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
2521 Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
2522 That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
2523 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
2524 Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
2525 Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
2526 Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
2527 And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
2528 To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
2529 For in the fatness of these pursy times
2530 Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
2531 Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
2533 O, throw away the worser part of it,
2534 And live the purer with the other half.
2535 Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
2536 Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
2537 That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
2538 Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
2539 That to the use of actions fair and good
2540 He likewise gives a frock or livery,
2541 That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
2542 And that shall lend a kind of easiness
2543 To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
2544 For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
2545 And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out
2546 With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
2547 And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
2548 I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
2549 I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
2550 To punish me with this and this with me,
2551 That I must be their scourge and minister.
2552 I will bestow him, and will answer well
2553 The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
2554 I must be cruel, only to be kind:
2555 Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
2556 One word more, good lady.
2558 Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
2559 Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
2560 Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
2561 And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
2562 Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
2563 Make you to ravel all this matter out,
2564 That I essentially am not in madness,
2565 But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
2566 For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
2567 Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
2568 Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
2569 No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
2570 Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
2571 Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
2572 To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
2573 And break your own neck down.
2577 I must to England; you know that?
2580 There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
2581 Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
2582 They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
2583 And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
2584 For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
2585 Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
2586 But I will delve one yard below their mines,
2587 And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
2588 When in one line two crafts directly meet.
2589 This man shall set me packing:
2590 I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
2591 Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
2592 Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
2593 Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
2594 Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
2595 Good night, mother.
2638 Safely stowed.
2640 What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
2641 O, here they come.
2643 Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
2646 Do not believe it.
2648 That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
2649 Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
2650 replication should be made by the son of a king?
2652 Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
2653 rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
2654 king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
2655 an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
2656 be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
2657 gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
2658 shall be dry again.
2660 I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
2661 foolish ear.
2664 The body is with the king, but the king is not with
2665 the body. The king is a thing--
2667 Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
2687 At supper.
2689 Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
2690 convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
2691 worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
2692 creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
2693 maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
2694 variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
2695 that's the end.
2697 A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
2698 king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
2700 Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
2701 progress through the guts of a beggar.
2703 In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
2704 find him not there, seek him i' the other place
2705 yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
2706 this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
2707 stairs into the lobby.
2709 He will stay till ye come.
2717                   For England!
2719 Good.
2721 I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
2722 England! Farewell, dear mother.
2724 My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
2725 and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
2750 Good sir, whose powers are these?
2752 How purposed, sir, I pray you?
2754 Who commands them, sir?
2756 Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
2757 Or for some frontier?
2764 Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
2766 Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
2767 Will not debate the question of this straw:
2768 This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
2769 That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
2770 Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
2773 I'll be with you straight go a little before.
2774 How all occasions do inform against me,
2775 And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
2776 If his chief good and market of his time
2777 Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
2778 Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
2779 Looking before and after, gave us not
2780 That capability and god-like reason
2781 To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
2782 Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
2783 Of thinking too precisely on the event,
2784 A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
2785 And ever three parts coward, I do not know
2786 Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
2787 Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
2788 To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
2789 Witness this army of such mass and charge
2790 Led by a delicate and tender prince,
2791 Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
2792 Makes mouths at the invisible event,
2793 Exposing what is mortal and unsure
2794 To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
2795 Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
2796 Is not to stir without great argument,
2797 But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
2798 When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
2799 That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
2800 Excitements of my reason and my blood,
2801 And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
2802 The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
2803 That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
2804 Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
2805 Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
2806 Which is not tomb enough and continent
2807 To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
2808 My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
3347 Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
3348 sings at grave-making?
3350 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
3351 the daintier sense.
3357 That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
3358 how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
3359 Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
3360 might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
3361 now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
3362 might it not?
3364 Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
3365 sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
3366 be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
3367 such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
3369 Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
3370 knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
3371 here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
3372 see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
3373 but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
3379 There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
3380 lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
3381 his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
3382 suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
3383 sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
3384 his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
3385 in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
3386 his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
3387 his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
3388 the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
3389 pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
3390 no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
3391 the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
3392 very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
3393 this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
3395 Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
3397 They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
3398 in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
3399 grave's this, sirrah?
3403 I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
3406 'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
3407 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
3410 What man dost thou dig it for?
3412 What woman, then?
3414 Who is to be buried in't?
3416 How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
3417 card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
3418 Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
3419 it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
3420 peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
3421 gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
3422 grave-maker?
3425 How long is that since?
3429 Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
3432 Why?
3435 How came he mad?
3437 How strangely?
3439 Upon what ground?
3442 How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
3447 Why he more than another?
3453 Whose was it?
3455 Nay, I know not.
3459 This?
3461 Let me see.
3462 Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
3463 of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
3464 borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
3465 abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
3466 it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
3467 not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
3468 gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
3469 that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
3470 now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
3471 Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
3472 her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
3473 come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
3474 me one thing.
3476 Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
3477 the earth?
3479 And smelt so? pah!
3481 To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
3482 not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
3483 till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
3485 No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
3486 modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
3487 thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
3488 Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
3489 earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
3490 was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
3491 Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
3492 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
3493 O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
3494 Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
3495 But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
3496 The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
3497 And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
3498 The corse they follow did with desperate hand
3499 Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
3500 Couch we awhile, and mark.
3502 That is Laertes,
3503 A very noble youth: mark.
3524 What, the fair Ophelia!
3538 [Advancing]     What is he whose grief
3539 Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
3540 Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
3541 Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
3542 Hamlet the Dane.
3544 Thou pray'st not well.
3545 I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
3546 For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
3547 Yet have I something in me dangerous,
3548 Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
3553 Why I will fight with him upon this theme
3554 Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
3556 I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
3557 Could not, with all their quantity of love,
3558 Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
3561 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
3562 Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
3563 Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
3564 I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
3565 To outface me with leaping in her grave?
3566 Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
3567 And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
3568 Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
3569 Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
3570 Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
3571 I'll rant as well as thou.
3577 Hear you, sir;
3578 What is the reason that you use me thus?
3579 I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
3580 Let Hercules himself do what he may,
3581 The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
3589 So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
3590 You do remember all the circumstance?
3592 Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
3593 That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
3594 Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
3595 And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
3596 Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
3597 When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
3598 There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
3599 Rough-hew them how we will,--
3601 Up from my cabin,
3602 My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
3603 Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
3604 Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
3605 To mine own room again; making so bold,
3606 My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
3607 Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
3608 O royal knavery!--an exact command,
3609 Larded with many several sorts of reasons
3610 Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
3611 With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
3612 That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
3613 No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
3614 My head should be struck off.
3616 Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
3617 But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
3619 Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
3620 Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
3621 They had begun the play--I sat me down,
3622 Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
3623 I once did hold it, as our statists do,
3624 A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
3625 How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
3626 It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
3627 The effect of what I wrote?
3629 An earnest conjuration from the king,
3630 As England was his faithful tributary,
3631 As love between them like the palm might flourish,
3632 As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
3633 And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
3634 And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
3635 That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
3636 Without debatement further, more or less,
3637 He should the bearers put to sudden death,
3638 Not shriving-time allow'd.
3640 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
3641 I had my father's signet in my purse,
3642 Which was the model of that Danish seal;
3643 Folded the writ up in form of the other,
3644 Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
3645 The changeling never known. Now, the next day
3646 Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
3647 Thou know'st already.
3649 Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
3650 They are not near my conscience; their defeat
3651 Does by their own insinuation grow:
3652 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
3653 Between the pass and fell incensed points
3654 Of mighty opposites.
3656 Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
3657 He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
3658 Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
3659 Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
3660 And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
3661 To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
3662 To let this canker of our nature come
3663 In further evil?
3666 It will be short: the interim is mine;
3667 And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
3668 But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
3669 That to Laertes I forgot myself;
3670 For, by the image of my cause, I see
3671 The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
3672 But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
3673 Into a towering passion.
3676 I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
3678 Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
3679 know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
3680 beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
3681 the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
3682 spacious in the possession of dirt.
3685 I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
3686 spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
3688 No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
3689 northerly.
3691 But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
3692 complexion.
3697 I beseech you, remember--
3705 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
3706 though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
3707 dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
3708 neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
3709 verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
3710 great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
3711 rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
3712 semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
3713 him, his umbrage, nothing more.
3715 The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
3716 in our more rawer breath?
3720 What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
3723 Of him, sir.
3725 I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
3726 it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
3728 I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
3729 him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
3730 know himself.
3733 What's his weapon?
3735 That's two of his weapons: but, well.
3743 What call you the carriages?
3746 The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
3747 could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
3748 be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
3749 against six French swords, their assigns, and three
3750 liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
3751 against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
3757 How if I answer 'no'?
3759 Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
3760 majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
3761 the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
3762 king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
3763 if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
3765 To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
3767 Yours, yours.
3768 He does well to commend it himself; there are no
3769 tongues else for's turn.
3771 He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
3772 Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
3773 know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
3774 the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
3775 yesty collection, which carries them through and
3776 through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
3777 but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
3782 I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
3783 pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
3784 or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
3786 In happy time.
3789 She well instructs me.
3791 I do not think so: since he went into France, I
3792 have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
3793 odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
3794 about my heart: but it is no matter.
3796 It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
3797 gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
3801 Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
3802 providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
3803 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
3804 now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
3805 readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
3806 leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
3808 Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
3809 But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
3810 This presence knows,
3811 And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
3812 With sore distraction. What I have done,
3813 That might your nature, honour and exception
3814 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
3815 Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
3816 If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
3817 And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
3818 Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
3819 Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
3820 Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
3821 His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
3822 Sir, in this audience,
3823 Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
3824 Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
3825 That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
3826 And hurt my brother.
3836 I embrace it freely;
3837 And will this brother's wager frankly play.
3838 Give us the foils. Come on.
3840 I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
3841 Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
3842 Stick fiery off indeed.
3844 No, by this hand.
3847 Very well, my lord
3848 Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
3852 This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
3867 Come on, sir.
3869 One.
3871 Judgment.
3877 I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
3878 Another hit; what say you?
3884 Good madam!
3888 I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
3893 Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
3894 I pray you, pass with your best violence;
3895 I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
3900 Nay, come, again.
3906 How does the queen?
3910 O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
3911 Treachery! Seek it out.
3920 The point!--envenom'd too!
3921 Then, venom, to thy work.
3924 Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
3925 Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
3926 Follow my mother.
3932 Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
3933 I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
3934 You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
3935 That are but mutes or audience to this act,
3936 Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
3937 Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
3938 But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
3939 Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
3940 To the unsatisfied.
3944 As thou'rt a man,
3945 Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
3946 O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
3947 Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
3948 If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
3949 Absent thee from felicity awhile,
3950 And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
3951 To tell my story.
3952 What warlike noise is this?
3956 O, I die, Horatio;
3957 The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
3958 I cannot live to hear the news from England;
3959 But I do prophesy the election lights
3960 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
3961 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
3962 Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
