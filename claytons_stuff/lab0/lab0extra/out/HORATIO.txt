16 Friends to this ground.
26 A piece of him.
37 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
42 Well, sit we down,
43 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
53 Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
56 What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
57 Together with that fair and warlike form
58 In which the majesty of buried Denmark
59 Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
62 Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
67 Before my God, I might not this believe
68 Without the sensible and true avouch
69 Of mine own eyes.
71 As thou art to thyself:
72 Such was the very armour he had on
73 When he the ambitious Norway combated;
74 So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
75 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
76 'Tis strange.
79 In what particular thought to work I know not;
80 But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
81 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
92 That can I;
93 At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
94 Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
95 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
96 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
97 Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
98 For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
99 Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
100 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
101 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
102 Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
103 Against the which, a moiety competent
104 Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
105 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
106 Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
107 And carriage of the article design'd,
108 His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
109 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
110 Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
111 Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
112 For food and diet, to some enterprise
113 That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
114 As it doth well appear unto our state--
115 But to recover of us, by strong hand
116 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
117 So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
118 Is the main motive of our preparations,
119 The source of this our watch and the chief head
120 Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
125 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
126 In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
127 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
128 The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
129 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
130 As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
131 Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
132 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
133 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
134 And even the like precurse of fierce events,
135 As harbingers preceding still the fates
136 And prologue to the omen coming on,
137 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
138 Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
139 But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
140 I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
141 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
142 Speak to me:
143 If there be any good thing to be done,
144 That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
145 Speak to me:
146 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
147 Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
148 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
149 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
150 For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
151 Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
153 Do, if it will not stand.
155 'Tis here!
162 And then it started like a guilty thing
163 Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
164 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
165 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
166 Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
167 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
168 The extravagant and erring spirit hies
169 To his confine: and of the truth herein
170 This present object made probation.
179 So have I heard and do in part believe it.
180 But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
181 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
182 Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
183 Let us impart what we have seen to-night
184 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
185 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
186 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
187 As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
352 Hail to your lordship!
355 The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
361 A truant disposition, good my lord.
368 My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
371 Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
377 Where, my lord?
379 I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
382 My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
384 My lord, the king your father.
386 Season your admiration for awhile
387 With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
388 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
389 This marvel to you.
391 Two nights together had these gentlemen,
392 Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
393 In the dead vast and middle of the night,
394 Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
395 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
396 Appears before them, and with solemn march
397 Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
398 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
399 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
400 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
401 Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
402 In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
403 And I with them the third night kept the watch;
404 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
405 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
406 The apparition comes: I knew your father;
407 These hands are not more like.
411 My lord, I did;
412 But answer made it none: yet once methought
413 It lifted up its head and did address
414 Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
415 But even then the morning cock crew loud,
416 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
417 And vanish'd from our sight.
419 As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
420 And we did think it writ down in our duty
421 To let you know of it.
433 O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
435 A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
437 Nay, very pale.
439 Most constantly.
441 It would have much amazed you.
443 While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
446 Not when I saw't.
448 It was, as I have seen it in his life,
449 A sable silver'd.
452 I warrant it will.
610 It is a nipping and an eager air.
612                   I think it lacks of twelve.
614 Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
615 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
616 What does this mean, my lord?
622 Is it a custom?
649 Look, my lord, it comes!
669 It beckons you to go away with it,
670 As if it some impartment did desire
671 To you alone.
675 No, by no means.
677 Do not, my lord.
683 What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
684 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
685 That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
686 And there assume some other horrible form,
687 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
688 And draw you into madness? think of it:
689 The very place puts toys of desperation,
690 Without more motive, into every brain
691 That looks so many fathoms to the sea
692 And hears it roar beneath.
697 Be ruled; you shall not go.
704 He waxes desperate with imagination.
706 Have after. To what issue will this come?
708 Heaven will direct it.
830 [Within]	Heaven secure him!
832 [Within]  Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
835 What news, my lord?
837                   Good my lord, tell it.
839 Not I, my lord, by heaven.
843 MARCELLUS.
844 Ay, by heaven, my lord.
847 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
848 To tell us this.
856 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
859 There's no offence, my lord.
867 What is't, my lord? we will.
869 MARCELLUS.
870 My lord, we will not.
872 In faith,
873 My lord, not I.
883                   Propose the oath, my lord.
895 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
1921 Here, sweet lord, at your service.
1924 O, my dear lord,--
1957 Well, my lord:
1958 If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
1959 And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
2142 Half a share.
2148 You might have rhymed.
2151 Very well, my lord.
2153 I did very well note him.
2824 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
2825 Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
3044 What are they that would speak with me?
3046 Let them come in.
3047 I do not know from what part of the world
3048 I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
3050 Let him bless thee too.
3055 [Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
3056 this, give these fellows some means to the king:
3057 they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
3058 at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
3059 chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
3060 a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
3061 them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
3062 I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
3063 me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
3064 did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
3065 have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
3066 with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
3067 have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
3068 dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
3069 the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
3070 where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
3071 course for England: of them I have much to tell
3072 thee. Farewell.
3073 'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
3074 Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
3075 And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
3076 To him from whom you brought them.
3349 Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
3363 It might, my lord.
3368 Ay, my lord.
3394 Not a jot more, my lord.
3396 Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
3475 What's that, my lord?
3478 E'en so.
3480 E'en so, my lord.
3484 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
3552                   Good my lord, be quiet.
3591 Remember it, my lord?
3600 That is most certain.
3615 Is't possible?
3618 I beseech you.
3628 Ay, good my lord.
3639 How was this seal'd?
3648 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
3655 Why, what a king is this!
3664 It must be shortly known to him from England
3665 What is the issue of the business there.
3674 Peace! who comes here?
3677 No, my good lord.
3718 Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
3719 You will do't, sir, really.
3722 His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
3744 I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
3770 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
3790 You will lose this wager, my lord.
3795 Nay, good my lord,--
3798 If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
3799 forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
3800 fit.
3902 They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
3941 Never believe it:
3942 I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
3943 Here's yet some liquor left.
3963 Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
3964 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
3965 Why does the drum come hither?
3967 What is it ye would see?
3968 If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
3979 Not from his mouth,
3980 Had it the ability of life to thank you:
3981 He never gave commandment for their death.
3982 But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
3983 You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
3984 Are here arrived give order that these bodies
3985 High on a stage be placed to the view;
3986 And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
3987 How these things came about: so shall you hear
3988 Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
3989 Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
3990 Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
3991 And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
3992 Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
3993 Truly deliver.
3999 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
4000 And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
4001 But let this same be presently perform'd,
4002 Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
4003 On plots and errors, happen.
