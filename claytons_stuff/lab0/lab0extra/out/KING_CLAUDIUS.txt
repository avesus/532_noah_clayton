190 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
191 The memory be green, and that it us befitted
192 To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
193 To be contracted in one brow of woe,
194 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
195 That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
196 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
197 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
198 The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
199 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
200 With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
201 With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
202 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
203 Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
204 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
205 With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
206 Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
207 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
208 Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
209 Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
210 Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
211 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
212 Importing the surrender of those lands
213 Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
214 To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
215 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
216 Thus much the business is: we have here writ
217 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
218 Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
219 Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
220 His further gait herein; in that the levies,
221 The lists and full proportions, are all made
222 Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
223 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
224 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
225 Giving to you no further personal power
226 To business with the king, more than the scope
227 Of these delated articles allow.
228 Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
231 We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
232 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
233 You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
234 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
235 And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
236 That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
237 The head is not more native to the heart,
238 The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
239 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
240 What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
248 Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
253 Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
254 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
255 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
257 How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
279 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
280 To give these mourning duties to your father:
281 But, you must know, your father lost a father;
282 That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
283 In filial obligation for some term
284 To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
285 In obstinate condolement is a course
286 Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
287 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
288 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
289 An understanding simple and unschool'd:
290 For what we know must be and is as common
291 As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
292 Why should we in our peevish opposition
293 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
294 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
295 To reason most absurd: whose common theme
296 Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
297 From the first corse till he that died to-day,
298 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
299 This unprevailing woe, and think of us
300 As of a father: for let the world take note,
301 You are the most immediate to our throne;
302 And with no less nobility of love
303 Than that which dearest father bears his son,
304 Do I impart toward you. For your intent
305 In going back to school in Wittenberg,
306 It is most retrograde to our desire:
307 And we beseech you, bend you to remain
308 Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
309 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
313 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
314 Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
315 This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
316 Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
317 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
318 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
319 And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
320 Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
1052 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
1053 Moreover that we much did long to see you,
1054 The need we have to use you did provoke
1055 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
1056 Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
1057 Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
1058 Resembles that it was. What it should be,
1059 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
1060 So much from the understanding of himself,
1061 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
1062 That, being of so young days brought up with him,
1063 And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
1064 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
1065 Some little time: so by your companies
1066 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
1067 So much as from occasion you may glean,
1068 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
1069 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
1086 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
1096 Thou still hast been the father of good news.
1104 O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
1107 Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
1108 He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
1109 The head and source of all your son's distemper.
1112 Well, we shall sift him.
1113 Welcome, my good friends!
1114 Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
1136 It likes us well;
1137 And at our more consider'd time well read,
1138 Answer, and think upon this business.
1139 Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
1140 Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
1141 Most welcome home!
1186 But how hath she
1187 Received his love?
1189 As of a man faithful and honourable.
1211 Do you think 'tis this?
1216 Not that I know.
1222                   How may we try it further?
1232 We will try it.
1667 And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
1668 Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
1669 Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
1670 With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
1693 With all my heart; and it doth much content me
1694 To hear him so inclined.
1695 Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
1696 And drive his purpose on to these delights.
1698                   Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
1699 For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
1700 That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
1701 Affront Ophelia:
1702 Her father and myself, lawful espials,
1703 Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
1704 We may of their encounter frankly judge,
1705 And gather by him, as he is behaved,
1706 If 't be the affliction of his love or no
1707 That thus he suffers for.
1723 [Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
1724 How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
1725 The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
1726 Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
1727 Than is my deed to my most painted word:
1728 O heavy burthen!
1841 Love! his affections do not that way tend;
1842 Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
1843 Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
1844 O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
1845 And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
1846 Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
1847 I have in quick determination
1848 Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
1849 For the demand of our neglected tribute
1850 Haply the seas and countries different
1851 With variable objects shall expel
1852 This something-settled matter in his heart,
1853 Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
1854 From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
1867 It shall be so:
1868 Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
1962 How fares our cousin Hamlet?
1965 I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
1966 are not mine.
2097 Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
2100 What do you call the play?
2132 Give me some light: away!
2259 I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
2260 To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
2261 I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
2262 And he to England shall along with you:
2263 The terms of our estate may not endure
2264 Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
2265 Out of his lunacies.
2283 Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
2284 For we will fetters put upon this fear,
2285 Which now goes too free-footed.
2297 Thanks, dear my lord.
2298 O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
2299 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
2300 A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
2301 Though inclination be as sharp as will:
2302 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
2303 And, like a man to double business bound,
2304 I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
2305 And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
2306 Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
2307 Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
2308 To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
2309 But to confront the visage of offence?
2310 And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
2311 To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
2312 Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
2313 My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
2314 Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
2315 That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
2316 Of those effects for which I did the murder,
2317 My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
2318 May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
2319 In the corrupted currents of this world
2320 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
2321 And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
2322 Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
2323 There is no shuffling, there the action lies
2324 In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
2325 Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
2326 To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
2327 Try what repentance can: what can it not?
2328 Yet what can it when one can not repent?
2329 O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
2330 O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
2331 Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
2332 Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
2333 Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
2334 All may be well.
2359 [Rising]  My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
2360 Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
2596 There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
2597 You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
2598 Where is your son?
2601 What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
2608 O heavy deed!
2609 It had been so with us, had we been there:
2610 His liberty is full of threats to all;
2611 To you yourself, to us, to every one.
2612 Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
2613 It will be laid to us, whose providence
2614 Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
2615 This mad young man: but so much was our love,
2616 We would not understand what was most fit;
2617 But, like the owner of a foul disease,
2618 To keep it from divulging, let it feed
2619 Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
2624 O Gertrude, come away!
2625 The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
2626 But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
2627 We must, with all our majesty and skill,
2628 Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
2629 Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
2630 Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
2631 And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
2632 Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
2633 Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
2634 Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
2635 And let them know, both what we mean to do,
2636 And what's untimely done. O, come away!
2637 My soul is full of discord and dismay.
2668 I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
2669 How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
2670 Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
2671 He's loved of the distracted multitude,
2672 Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
2673 And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
2674 But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
2675 This sudden sending him away must seem
2676 Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
2677 By desperate appliance are relieved,
2678 Or not at all.
2679 How now! what hath befall'n?
2682 But where is he?
2684 Bring him before us.
2686 Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
2688 At supper! where?
2696 Alas, alas!
2699 What dost you mean by this?
2702 Where is Polonius?
2708 Go seek him there.
2710 Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
2711 Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
2712 For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
2713 With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
2714 The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
2715 The associates tend, and every thing is bent
2716 For England.
2718 Ay, Hamlet.
2720 So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
2723 Thy loving father, Hamlet.
2726 Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
2727 Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
2728 Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
2729 That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
2730 And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
2731 As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
2732 Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
2733 After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
2734 Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
2735 Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
2736 By letters congruing to that effect,
2737 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
2738 For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
2739 And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
2740 Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
2852 How do you, pretty lady?
2856 Conceit upon her father.
2867 Pretty Ophelia!
2877 How long hath she been thus?
2884 Follow her close; give her good watch,
2885 I pray you.
2886 O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
2887 All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
2888 When sorrows come, they come not single spies
2889 But in battalions. First, her father slain:
2890 Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
2891 Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
2892 Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
2893 For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
2894 In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
2895 Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
2896 Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
2897 Last, and as much containing as all these,
2898 Her brother is in secret come from France;
2899 Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
2900 And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
2901 With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
2902 Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
2903 Will nothing stick our person to arraign
2904 In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
2905 Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
2906 Gives me superfluous death.
2908 Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
2909 What is the matter?
2923 The doors are broke.
2935                   What is the cause, Laertes,
2936 That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
2937 Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
2938 There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
2939 That treason can but peep to what it would,
2940 Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
2941 Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
2942 Speak, man.
2944 Dead.
2946 Let him demand his fill.
2954 Who shall stay you?
2958 Good Laertes,
2959 If you desire to know the certainty
2960 Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
2961 That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
2962 Winner and loser?
2964 Will you know them then?
2968 Why, now you speak
2969 Like a good child and a true gentleman.
2970 That I am guiltless of your father's death,
2971 And am most sensible in grief for it,
2972 It shall as level to your judgment pierce
2973 As day does to your eye.
3024 Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
3025 Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
3026 Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
3027 And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
3028 If by direct or by collateral hand
3029 They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
3030 Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
3031 To you in satisfaction; but if not,
3032 Be you content to lend your patience to us,
3033 And we shall jointly labour with your soul
3034 To give it due content.
3041 So you shall;
3042 And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
3043 I pray you, go with me.
3077 Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
3078 And you must put me in your heart for friend,
3079 Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
3080 That he which hath your noble father slain
3081 Pursued my life.
3087 O, for two special reasons;
3088 Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
3089 But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
3090 Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
3091 My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
3092 She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
3093 That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
3094 I could not but by her. The other motive,
3095 Why to a public count I might not go,
3096 Is the great love the general gender bear him;
3097 Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
3098 Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
3099 Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
3100 Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
3101 Would have reverted to my bow again,
3102 And not where I had aim'd them.
3108 Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
3109 That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
3110 That we can let our beard be shook with danger
3111 And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
3112 I loved your father, and we love ourself;
3113 And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
3114 How now! what news?
3117 From Hamlet! who brought them?
3121 Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
3128 'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
3129 And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
3130 Can you advise me?
3135 If it be so, Laertes--
3136 As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
3137 Will you be ruled by me?
3140 To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
3141 As checking at his voyage, and that he means
3142 No more to undertake it, I will work him
3143 To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
3144 Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
3145 And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
3146 But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
3147 And call it accident.
3151 It falls right.
3152 You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
3153 And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
3154 Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
3155 Did not together pluck such envy from him
3156 As did that one, and that, in my regard,
3157 Of the unworthiest siege.
3159 A very riband in the cap of youth,
3160 Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
3161 The light and careless livery that it wears
3162 Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
3163 Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
3164 Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
3165 I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
3166 And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
3167 Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
3168 And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
3169 As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
3170 With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
3171 That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
3172 Come short of what he did.
3174 A Norman.
3176 The very same.
3179 He made confession of you,
3180 And gave you such a masterly report
3181 For art and exercise in your defence
3182 And for your rapier most especially,
3183 That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
3184 If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
3185 He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
3186 If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
3187 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
3188 That he could nothing do but wish and beg
3189 Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
3190 Now, out of this,--
3192 Laertes, was your father dear to you?
3193 Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
3194 A face without a heart?
3196 Not that I think you did not love your father;
3197 But that I know love is begun by time;
3198 And that I see, in passages of proof,
3199 Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
3200 There lives within the very flame of love
3201 A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
3202 And nothing is at a like goodness still;
3203 For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
3204 Dies in his own too much: that we would do
3205 We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
3206 And hath abatements and delays as many
3207 As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
3208 And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
3209 That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
3210 Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
3211 To show yourself your father's son in deed
3212 More than in words?
3214 No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
3215 Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
3216 Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
3217 Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
3218 We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
3219 And set a double varnish on the fame
3220 The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
3221 And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
3222 Most generous and free from all contriving,
3223 Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
3224 Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
3225 A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
3226 Requite him for your father.
3237                   Let's further think of this;
3238 Weigh what convenience both of time and means
3239 May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
3240 And that our drift look through our bad performance,
3241 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
3242 Should have a back or second, that might hold,
3243 If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
3244 We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
3245 When in your motion you are hot and dry--
3246 As make your bouts more violent to that end--
3247 And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
3248 A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
3249 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
3250 Our purpose may hold there.
3251 How now, sweet queen!
3282 Let's follow, Gertrude:
3283 How much I had to do to calm his rage!
3284 Now fear I this will give it start again;
3285 Therefore let's follow.
3549 Pluck them asunder.
3559 O, he is mad, Laertes.
3582 I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
3583 Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
3584 We'll put the matter to the present push.
3585 Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
3586 This grave shall have a living monument:
3587 An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
3588 Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
3807 Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
3845 Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
3846 You know the wager?
3849 I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
3850 But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
3854 Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
3855 If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
3856 Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
3857 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
3858 The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
3859 And in the cup an union shall he throw,
3860 Richer than that which four successive kings
3861 In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
3862 And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
3863 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
3864 The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
3865 'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
3866 And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
3874 Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
3875 Here's to thy health.
3876 Give him the cup.
3880 Our son shall win.
3885           Gertrude, do not drink.
3887 [Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
3891 I do not think't.
3899 Part them; they are incensed.
3907 She swounds to see them bleed.
3923 O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
