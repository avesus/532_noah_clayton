241 My dread lord,
242 Your leave and favour to return to France;
243 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
244 To show my duty in your coronation,
245 Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
246 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
247 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
469 My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
470 And, sister, as the winds give benefit
471 And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
472 But let me hear from you.
474 For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
475 Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
476 A violet in the youth of primy nature,
477 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
478 The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
480 Think it no more;
481 For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
482 In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
483 The inward service of the mind and soul
484 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
485 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
486 The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
487 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
488 For he himself is subject to his birth:
489 He may not, as unvalued persons do,
490 Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
491 The safety and health of this whole state;
492 And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
493 Unto the voice and yielding of that body
494 Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
495 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
496 As he in his particular act and place
497 May give his saying deed; which is no further
498 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
499 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
500 If with too credent ear you list his songs,
501 Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
502 To his unmaster'd importunity.
503 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
504 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
505 Out of the shot and danger of desire.
506 The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
507 If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
508 Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
509 The canker galls the infants of the spring,
510 Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
511 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
512 Contagious blastments are most imminent.
513 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
514 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
522 O, fear me not.
523 I stay too long: but here my father comes.
524 A double blessing is a double grace,
525 Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
553 Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
555 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
556 What I have said to you.
559 Farewell.
2924 Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
2926                   I pray you, give me leave.
2928 I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
2929 Give me my father!
2931 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
2932 Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
2933 Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
2934 Of my true mother.
2943 Where is my father?
2947 How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
2948 To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
2949 Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
2950 I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
2951 That both the worlds I give to negligence,
2952 Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
2953 Most thoroughly for my father.
2955 My will, not all the world:
2956 And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
2957 They shall go far with little.
2963 None but his enemies.
2965 To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
2966 And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
2967 Repast them with my blood.
2975 How now! what noise is that?
2976 O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
2977 Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
2978 By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
2979 Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
2980 Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
2981 O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
2982 Should be as moral as an old man's life?
2983 Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
2984 It sends some precious instance of itself
2985 After the thing it loves.
2991 Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
2992 It could not move thus.
2998 This nothing's more than matter.
3001 A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
3009 Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
3010 She turns to favour and to prettiness.
3023 Do you see this, O God?
3035 Let this be so;
3036 His means of death, his obscure funeral--
3037 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
3038 No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
3039 Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
3040 That I must call't in question.
3082                   It well appears: but tell me
3083 Why you proceeded not against these feats,
3084 So crimeful and so capital in nature,
3085 As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
3086 You mainly were stirr'd up.
3103 And so have I a noble father lost;
3104 A sister driven into desperate terms,
3105 Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
3106 Stood challenger on mount of all the age
3107 For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
3127 Know you the hand?
3131 I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
3132 It warms the very sickness in my heart,
3133 That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
3134 'Thus didest thou.'
3138 Ay, my lord;
3139 So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
3148 My lord, I will be ruled;
3149 The rather, if you could devise it so
3150 That I might be the organ.
3158 What part is that, my lord?
3173 A Norman was't?
3175 Upon my life, Lamond.
3177 I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
3178 And gem of all the nation.
3191 What out of this, my lord?
3195 Why ask you this?
3213 To cut his throat i' the church.
3227 I will do't:
3228 And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
3229 I bought an unction of a mountebank,
3230 So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
3231 Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
3232 Collected from all simples that have virtue
3233 Under the moon, can save the thing from death
3234 That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
3235 With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
3236 It may be death.
3254 Drown'd! O, where?
3273                   Alas, then, she is drown'd?
3275 Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
3276 And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
3277 It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
3278 Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
3279 The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
3280 I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
3281 But that this folly douts it.
3501 What ceremony else?
3504 What ceremony else?
3514 Must there no more be done?
3519 Lay her i' the earth:
3520 And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
3521 May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
3522 A ministering angel shall my sister be,
3523 When thou liest howling.
3529 O, treble woe
3530 Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
3531 Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
3532 Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
3533 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
3534 Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
3535 Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
3536 To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
3537 Of blue Olympus.
3543                   The devil take thy soul!
3827 I am satisfied in nature,
3828 Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
3829 To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
3830 I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
3831 Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
3832 I have a voice and precedent of peace,
3833 To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
3834 I do receive your offer'd love like love,
3835 And will not wrong it.
3839 Come, one for me.
3843 You mock me, sir.
3851 This is too heavy, let me see another.
3868                   Come, my lord.
3870 No.
3873 Well; again.
3879 A touch, a touch, I do confess.
3890 My lord, I'll hit him now.
3892 [Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
3896 Say you so? come on.
3898 Have at you now!
3904 Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
3905 I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
3912 It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
3913 No medicine in the world can do thee good;
3914 In thee there is not half an hour of life;
3915 The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
3916 Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
3917 Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
3918 Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
3919 I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
3927                   He is justly served;
3928 It is a poison temper'd by himself.
3929 Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
3930 Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
3931 Nor thine on me.
