249 He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
250 By laboursome petition, and at last
251 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
252 I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
526 Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
527 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
528 And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
529 And these few precepts in thy memory
530 See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
531 Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
532 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
533 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
534 Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
535 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
536 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
537 Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
538 Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
539 Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
540 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
541 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
542 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
543 For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
544 And they in France of the best rank and station
545 Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
546 Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
547 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
548 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
549 This above all: to thine ownself be true,
550 And it must follow, as the night the day,
551 Thou canst not then be false to any man.
552 Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
554 The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
560 What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
562 Marry, well bethought:
563 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
564 Given private time to you; and you yourself
565 Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
566 If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
567 And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
568 You do not understand yourself so clearly
569 As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
570 What is between you? give me up the truth.
573 Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
574 Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
575 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
577 Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
578 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
579 Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
580 Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
581 Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
584 Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
587 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
588 When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
589 Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
590 Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
591 Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
592 You must not take for fire. From this time
593 Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
594 Set your entreatments at a higher rate
595 Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
596 Believe so much in him, that he is young
597 And with a larger tether may he walk
598 Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
599 Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
600 Not of that dye which their investments show,
601 But mere implorators of unholy suits,
602 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
603 The better to beguile. This is for all:
604 I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
605 Have you so slander any moment leisure,
606 As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
607 Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
922 Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
924 You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
925 Before you visit him, to make inquire
926 Of his behavior.
928 Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
929 Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
930 And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
931 What company, at what expense; and finding
932 By this encompassment and drift of question
933 That they do know my son, come you more nearer
934 Than your particular demands will touch it:
935 Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
936 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
937 And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
939 'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
940 But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
941 Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
942 What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
943 As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
944 But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
945 As are companions noted and most known
946 To youth and liberty.
948 Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
949 Drabbing: you may go so far.
951 'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
952 You must not put another scandal on him,
953 That he is open to incontinency;
954 That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
955 That they may seem the taints of liberty,
956 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
957 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
958 Of general assault.
960 Wherefore should you do this?
963                   Marry, sir, here's my drift;
964 And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
965 You laying these slight sullies on my son,
966 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
967 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
968 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
969 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
970 He closes with you in this consequence;
971 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
972 According to the phrase or the addition
973 Of man and country.
975 And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
976 about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
977 something: where did I leave?
980 At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
981 He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
982 I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
983 Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
984 There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
985 There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
986 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
987 Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
988 See you now;
989 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
990 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
991 With windlasses and with assays of bias,
992 By indirections find directions out:
993 So by my former lecture and advice,
994 Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
996                   God be wi' you; fare you well.
998 Observe his inclination in yourself.
1000 And let him ply his music.
1002 Farewell!
1004 With what, i' the name of God?
1013 Mad for thy love?
1016 What said he?
1031 Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
1032 This is the very ecstasy of love,
1033 Whose violent property fordoes itself
1034 And leads the will to desperate undertakings
1035 As oft as any passion under heaven
1036 That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
1037 What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1041                   That hath made him mad.
1042 I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
1043 I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
1044 And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
1045 By heaven, it is as proper to our age
1046 To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
1047 As it is common for the younger sort
1048 To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
1049 This must be known; which, being kept close, might
1050 move
1051 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
1094 The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
1095 Are joyfully return'd.
1097 Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
1098 I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
1099 Both to my God and to my gracious king:
1100 And I do think, or else this brain of mine
1101 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
1102 As it hath used to do, that I have found
1103 The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
1105 Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
1106 My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
1142                   This business is well ended.
1143 My liege, and madam, to expostulate
1144 What majesty should be, what duty is,
1145 Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
1146 Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
1147 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
1148 And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
1149 I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
1150 Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
1151 What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
1152 But let that go.
1154 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
1155 That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
1156 And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
1157 But farewell it, for I will use no art.
1158 Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
1159 That we find out the cause of this effect,
1160 Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
1161 For this effect defective comes by cause:
1162 Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
1163 I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
1164 Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
1165 Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
1166 'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
1167 beautified Ophelia,'--
1168 That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
1169 a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
1170 'In her excellent white bosom, these,  & c.'
1172 Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
1173 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
1174 Doubt that the sun doth move;
1175 Doubt truth to be a liar;
1176 But never doubt I love.
1177 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
1178 I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
1179 I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
1180 'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
1181 this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
1182 This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
1183 And more above, hath his solicitings,
1184 As they fell out by time, by means and place,
1185 All given to mine ear.
1188                   What do you think of me?
1190 I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
1191 When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
1192 As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
1193 Before my daughter told me--what might you,
1194 Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
1195 If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
1196 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
1197 Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
1198 What might you think? No, I went round to work,
1199 And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
1200 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
1201 This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
1202 That she should lock herself from his resort,
1203 Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
1204 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
1205 And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
1206 Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
1207 Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
1208 Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
1209 Into the madness wherein now he raves,
1210 And all we mourn for.
1213 Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
1214 That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
1215 When it proved otherwise?
1217 [Pointing to his head and shoulder]
1218 Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
1219 If circumstances lead me, I will find
1220 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
1221 Within the centre.
1223 You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
1224 Here in the lobby.
1226 At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
1227 Be you and I behind an arras then;
1228 Mark the encounter: if he love her not
1229 And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
1230 Let me be no assistant for a state,
1231 But keep a farm and carters.
1234 Away, I do beseech you, both away:
1235 I'll board him presently.
1237 Do you know me, my lord?
1239 Not I, my lord.
1241 Honest, my lord!
1244 That's very true, my lord.
1247 I have, my lord.
1251 [Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
1252 daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
1253 was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
1254 truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
1255 love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
1256 What do you read, my lord?
1258 What is the matter, my lord?
1260 I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
1270 [Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
1271 in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
1273 Indeed, that is out o' the air.
1274 How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
1275 that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
1276 could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
1277 leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
1278 meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
1279 lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
1283 Fare you well, my lord.
1285 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
1439 Well be with you, gentlemen!
1448 My lord, I have news to tell you.
1451 The actors are come hither, my lord.
1453 Upon mine honour,--
1455 The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
1456 comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
1457 historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
1458 comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
1459 poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
1460 Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
1461 liberty, these are the only men.
1463 What a treasure had he, my lord?
1467 [Aside]  Still on my daughter.
1469 If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
1470 that I love passing well.
1472 What follows, then, my lord?
1525 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
1526 good discretion.
1557 This is too long.
1563 That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
1579 Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
1580 tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
1587 My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
1593 Come, sirs.
1690 'Tis most true:
1691 And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
1692 To hear and see the matter.
1715 Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
1716 We will bestow ourselves.
1717 Read on this book;
1718 That show of such an exercise may colour
1719 Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
1720 'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
1721 And pious action we do sugar o'er
1722 The devil himself.
1729 I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
1855 It shall do well: but yet do I believe
1856 The origin and commencement of his grief
1857 Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
1858 You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
1859 We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
1860 But, if you hold it fit, after the play
1861 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
1862 To show his grief: let her be round with him;
1863 And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
1864 Of all their conference. If she find him not,
1865 To England send him, or confine him where
1866 Your wisdom best shall think.
1915 And the queen too, and that presently.
1969 That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
1971 I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
1972 Capitol; Brutus killed me.
1978 [To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?
2131 Give o'er the play.
2234 My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
2235 presently.
2237 By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
2239 It is backed like a weasel.
2241 Very like a whale.
2244 I will say so.
2288 My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
2289 Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
2290 To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
2291 And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
2292 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
2293 Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
2294 The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
2295 I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
2296 And tell you what I know.
2361 He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
2362 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
2363 And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
2364 Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
2365 Pray you, be round with him.
2386 [Behind]  What, ho! help, help, help!
2388 [Behind]  O, I am slain!
