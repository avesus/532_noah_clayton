3778 My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
3779 Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
3780 the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
3781 play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
3785 The king and queen and all are coming down.
3787 The queen desires you to use some gentle
3788 entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
