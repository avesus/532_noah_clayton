17 And liegemen to the Dane.
19 O, farewell, honest soldier:
20 Who hath relieved you?
23 Holla! Bernardo!
28 What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
30 Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
31 And will not let belief take hold of him
32 Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
33 Therefore I have entreated him along
34 With us to watch the minutes of this night;
35 That if again this apparition come,
36 He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
49 Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
51 Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
55 Question it, Horatio.
60 It is offended.
63 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
70                   Is it not like the king?
77 Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
78 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
82 Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
83 Why this same strict and most observant watch
84 So nightly toils the subject of the land,
85 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
86 And foreign mart for implements of war;
87 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
88 Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
89 What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
90 Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
91 Who is't that can inform me?
152 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
156 'Tis gone!
157 We do it wrong, being so majestical,
158 To offer it the show of violence;
159 For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
160 And our vain blows malicious mockery.
171 It faded on the crowing of the cock.
172 Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
173 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
174 The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
175 And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
176 The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
177 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
178 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
188 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
189 Where we shall find him most conveniently.
358 My good lord--
409 My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
424 BERNARDO.
425 We do, my lord.
427 BERNARDO.
428 Arm'd, my lord.
430 BERNARDO.
431 My lord, from head to foot.
444 BERNARDO.
445 Longer, longer.
672                   Look, with what courteous action
673 It waves you to a more removed ground:
674 But do not go with it.
695 You shall not go, my lord.
705 Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
707 Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
709 Nay, let's follow him.
827 HORATIO.
828 [Within]  My lord, my lord,--
829 [Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
834 How is't, my noble lord?
840 Nor I, my lord.
874                   Nor I, my lord, in faith.
876                   We have sworn, my lord, already.
