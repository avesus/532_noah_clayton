473 Do you doubt that?
479        No more but so?
515 I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
516 As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
517 Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
518 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
519 Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
520 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
521 And recks not his own rede.
557 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
558 And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
561 So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
571 He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
572 Of his affection to me.
576 I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
582 My lord, he hath importuned me with love
583 In honourable fashion.
585 And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
586 With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
608 I shall obey, my lord.
1003 O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
1005 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
1006 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
1007 No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
1008 Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
1009 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
1010 And with a look so piteous in purport
1011 As if he had been loosed out of hell
1012 To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
1014                   My lord, I do not know;
1015 But truly, I do fear it.
1017 He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
1018 Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
1019 And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
1020 He falls to such perusal of my face
1021 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
1022 At last, a little shaking of mine arm
1023 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
1024 He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
1025 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
1026 And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
1027 And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
1028 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
1029 For out o' doors he went without their helps,
1030 And, to the last, bended their light on me.
1038 No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
1039 I did repel his fetters and denied
1040 His access to me.
1714 Madam, I wish it may.
1765 Good my lord,
1766 How does your honour for this many a day?
1768 My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
1769 That I have longed long to re-deliver;
1770 I pray you, now receive them.
1773 My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
1774 And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
1775 As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
1776 Take these again; for to the noble mind
1777 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
1778 There, my lord.
1780 My lord?
1782 What means your lordship?
1785 Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
1786 with honesty?
1792 Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
1796 I was the more deceived.
1808 At home, my lord.
1811 O, help him, you sweet heavens!
1819 O heavenly powers, restore him!
1829 O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
1830 The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
1831 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
1832 The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
1833 The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
1834 And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
1835 That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
1836 Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
1837 Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
1838 That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
1839 Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
1840 To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
1980 No, my lord.
1982 Ay, my lord.
1984 I think nothing, my lord.
1986 What is, my lord?
1988 You are merry, my lord.
1990 Ay, my lord.
1994 Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
2003 What means this, my lord?
2005 Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
2008 Will he tell us what this show meant?
2011 You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
2016 'Tis brief, my lord.
2109 You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
2112 You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
2114 Still better, and worse.
2128 The king rises.
2831 Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
2833 [Sings]
2834 How should I your true love know
2835 From another one?
2836 By his cockle hat and staff,
2837 And his sandal shoon.
2839 Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
2840 He is dead and gone, lady,
2841 He is dead and gone;
2842 At his head a grass-green turf,
2843 At his heels a stone.
2845 Pray you, mark.
2846 White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
2848 [Sings]
2849 Larded with sweet flowers
2850 Which bewept to the grave did go
2851 With true-love showers.
2853 Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
2854 daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
2855 what we may be. God be at your table!
2857 Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
2858 ask you what it means, say you this:
2859 To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
2860 All in the morning betime,
2861 And I a maid at your window,
2862 To be your Valentine.
2863 Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
2864 And dupp'd the chamber-door;
2865 Let in the maid, that out a maid
2866 Never departed more.
2868 Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
2869 By Gis and by Saint Charity,
2870 Alack, and fie for shame!
2871 Young men will do't, if they come to't;
2872 By cock, they are to blame.
2873 Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
2874 You promised me to wed.
2875 So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
2876 An thou hadst not come to my bed.
2878 I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
2879 cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
2880 i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
2881 and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
2882 coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
2883 good night, good night.
2986 [Sings]
2987 They bore him barefaced on the bier;
2988 Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
2989 And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
2990 Fare you well, my dove!
2993 [Sings]
2994 You must sing a-down a-down,
2995 An you call him a-down-a.
2996 O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
2997 steward, that stole his master's daughter.
2999 There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
3000 love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
3002 There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
3003 for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
3004 herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
3005 a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
3006 some violets, but they withered all when my father
3007 died: they say he made a good end,--
3008 For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
3011 [Sings]
3012 And will he not come again?
3013 And will he not come again?
3014 No, no, he is dead:
3015 Go to thy death-bed:
3016 He never will come again.
3017 His beard was as white as snow,
3018 All flaxen was his poll:
3019 He is gone, he is gone,
3020 And we cast away moan:
3021 God ha' mercy on his soul!
3022 And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
