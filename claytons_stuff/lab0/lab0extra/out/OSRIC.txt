3675 Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
3683 Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
3684 should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
3687 I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
3690 It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
3693 Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
3694 'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
3695 majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
3696 great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
3698 Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
3699 Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
3700 me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
3701 differences, of very soft society and great showing:
3702 indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
3703 calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
3704 continent of what part a gentleman would see.
3714 Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
3717 Sir?
3721 Of Laertes?
3724 I know you are not ignorant--
3727 You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
3731 I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
3732 laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
3734 Rapier and dagger.
3736 The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
3737 horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
3738 it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
3739 assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
3740 carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
3741 responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
3742 and of very liberal conceit.
3745 The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
3752 The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
3753 between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
3754 three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
3755 would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
3756 would vouchsafe the answer.
3758 I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
3764 Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
3766 I commend my duty to your lordship.
3853 Ay, my good lord.
3872 A hit, a very palpable hit.
3897 Nothing, neither way.
3901                   Look to the queen there, ho!
3903 How is't, Laertes?
3953 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
3954 To the ambassadors of England gives
3955 This warlike volley.
