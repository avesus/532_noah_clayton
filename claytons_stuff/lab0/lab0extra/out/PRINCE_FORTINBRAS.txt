2741 Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
2742 Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
2743 Craves the conveyance of a promised march
2744 Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
2745 If that his majesty would aught with us,
2746 We shall express our duty in his eye;
2747 And let him know so.
2749 Go softly on.
3966 Where is this sight?
3969 This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
3970 What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
3971 That thou so many princes at a shot
3972 So bloodily hast struck?
3994                   Let us haste to hear it,
3995 And call the noblest to the audience.
3996 For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
3997 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
3998 Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
4004 Let four captains
4005 Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
4006 For he was likely, had he been put on,
4007 To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
4008 The soldiers' music and the rites of war
4009 Speak loudly for him.
4010 Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
4011 Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
4012 Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
