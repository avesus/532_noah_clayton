2018    Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
2019 Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
2020 And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
2021 About the world have times twelve thirties been,
2022 Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
2023 Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
2036 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
2037 My operant powers their functions leave to do:
2038 And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
2039 Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
2040 For husband shalt thou--
2050    I do believe you think what now you speak;
2051 But what we do determine oft we break.
2052 Purpose is but the slave to memory,
2053 Of violent birth, but poor validity;
2054 Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
2055 But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
2056 Most necessary 'tis that we forget
2057 To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
2058 What to ourselves in passion we propose,
2059 The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
2060 The violence of either grief or joy
2061 Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
2062 Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
2063 Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
2064 This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
2065 That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
2066 For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
2067 Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
2068 The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
2069 The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
2070 And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
2071 For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
2072 And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
2073 Directly seasons him his enemy.
2074 But, orderly to end where I begun,
2075 Our wills and fates do so contrary run
2076 That our devices still are overthrown;
2077 Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
2078 So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
2079 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
2089 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
2090 My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
2091 The tedious day with sleep.
