2024    So many journeys may the sun and moon
2025 Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
2026 But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
2027 So far from cheer and from your former state,
2028 That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
2029 Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
2030 For women's fear and love holds quantity;
2031 In neither aught, or in extremity.
2032 Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
2033 And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
2034 Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
2035 Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
2041 O, confound the rest!
2042 Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
2043 In second husband let me be accurst!
2044 None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
2046    The instances that second marriage move
2047 Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
2048 A second time I kill my husband dead,
2049 When second husband kisses me in bed.
2080    Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
2081 Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
2082 To desperation turn my trust and hope!
2083 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
2084 Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
2085 Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
2086 Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
2087 If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
2092 Sleep rock thy brain,
2093 And never come mischance between us twain!
