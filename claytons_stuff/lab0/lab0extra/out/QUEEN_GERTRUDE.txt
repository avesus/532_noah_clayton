259 Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
260 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
261 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
262 Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
263 Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
264 Passing through nature to eternity.
266 If it be,
267 Why seems it so particular with thee?
310 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
311 I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
1070 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
1071 And sure I am two men there are not living
1072 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1073 To show us so much gentry and good will
1074 As to expend your time with us awhile,
1075 For the supply and profit of our hope,
1076 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
1077 As fits a king's remembrance.
1087 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
1088 And I beseech you instantly to visit
1089 My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
1090 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
1093 Ay, amen!
1110 I doubt it is no other but the main;
1111 His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
1153                   More matter, with less art.
1171 Came this from Hamlet to her?
1212 It may be, very likely.
1225                   So he does indeed.
1233 But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
1677                   Did he receive you well?
1682 Did you assay him?
1683 To any pastime?
1708 I shall obey you.
1709 And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
1710 That your good beauties be the happy cause
1711 Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
1712 Will bring him to his wonted way again,
1713 To both your honours.
1976 Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
2095 The lady protests too much, methinks.
2130 How fares my lord?
2367 I'll warrant you,
2368 Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
2370 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
2372 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
2374 Why, how now, Hamlet!
2376 Have you forgot me?
2380 Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
2384 What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
2385 Help, help, ho!
2389 O me, what hast thou done?
2392 O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
2395 As kill a king!
2405 What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
2406 In noise so rude against me?
2419 Ay me, what act,
2420 That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
2457 O Hamlet, speak no more:
2458 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
2459 And there I see such black and grained spots
2460 As will not leave their tinct.
2465 O, speak to me no more;
2466 These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
2467 No more, sweet Hamlet!
2474 No more!
2478 Alas, he's mad!
2489 Alas, how is't with you,
2490 That you do bend your eye on vacancy
2491 And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
2492 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
2493 And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
2494 Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
2495 Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
2496 Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
2497 Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
2504 To whom do you speak this?
2506 Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
2508 No, nothing but ourselves.
2512 This the very coinage of your brain:
2513 This bodiless creation ecstasy
2514 Is very cunning in.
2532 O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
2557 What shall I do?
2574 Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
2575 And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
2576 What thou hast said to me.
2578 Alack,
2579 I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
2599 Bestow this place on us a little while.
2600 Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
2602 Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
2603 Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
2604 Behind the arras hearing something stir,
2605 Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
2606 And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
2607 The unseen good old man.
2620 To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
2621 O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
2622 Among a mineral of metals base,
2623 Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
2809 I will not speak with her.
2812 What would she have?
2826 Let her come in.
2827 To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
2828 Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
2829 So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
2830 It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
2832 How now, Ophelia!
2838 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
2844 Nay, but, Ophelia,--
2847 Alas, look here, my lord.
2907 Alack, what noise is this?
2921 How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
2922 O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
2930                   Calmly, good Laertes.
2945 But not by him.
3252 One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
3253 So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
3255 There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
3256 That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
3257 There with fantastic garlands did she come
3258 Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
3259 That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
3260 But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
3261 There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
3262 Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
3263 When down her weedy trophies and herself
3264 Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
3265 And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
3266 Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
3267 As one incapable of her own distress,
3268 Or like a creature native and indued
3269 Unto that element: but long it could not be
3270 Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
3271 Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
3272 To muddy death.
3274 Drown'd, drown'd.
3525 Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
3526 I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
3527 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
3528 And not have strew'd thy grave.
3550 Hamlet, Hamlet!
3555 O my son, what theme?
3560 For love of God, forbear him.
3572 This is mere madness:
3573 And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
3574 Anon, as patient as the female dove,
3575 When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
3576 His silence will sit drooping.
3881                   He's fat, and scant of breath.
3882 Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
3883 The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
3886 I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
3889 Come, let me wipe thy face.
3908 No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
3909 The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
