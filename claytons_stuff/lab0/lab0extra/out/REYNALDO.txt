923 I will, my lord.
927                   My lord, I did intend it.
938 Ay, very well, my lord.
947 As gaming, my lord.
950 My lord, that would dishonour him.
959 But, my good lord,--
961 Ay, my lord,
962 I would know that.
974 Very good, my lord.
978 At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
979 and 'gentleman.'
995 My lord, I have.
997 Good my lord!
999 I shall, my lord.
1001 Well, my lord.
