1078 Both your majesties
1079 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
1080 Put your dread pleasures more into command
1081 Than to entreaty.
1286 [To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!
1288 My most dear lord!
1291 As the indifferent children of the earth.
1295 Neither, my lord.
1301 None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
1308 Then is the world one.
1311 We think not so, my lord.
1315 Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
1316 narrow for your mind.
1323 Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
1324 quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
1328 GUILDENSTERN.
1329 We'll wait upon you.
1334 To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
1345 To what end, my lord?
1352 [Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
1375 My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
1377 To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
1378 lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
1379 you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
1380 coming, to offer you service.
1389 Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
1390 tragedians of the city.
1393 I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
1394 late innovation.
1397 No, indeed, are they not.
1399 Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
1400 there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
1401 that cry out on the top of question, and are most
1402 tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
1403 fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
1404 call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
1405 goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
1413 'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
1414 the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
1415 controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
1416 for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
1417 cuffs in the question.
1421 Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
1443 Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
1444 say an old man is twice a child.
1606 Good my lord!
1671 He does confess he feels himself distracted;
1672 But from what cause he will by no means speak.
1678 Most like a gentleman.
1680 Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
1681 Most free in his reply.
1684 Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
1685 We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
1686 And there did seem in him a kind of joy
1687 To hear of it: they are about the court,
1688 And, as I think, they have already order
1689 This night to play before him.
1697 We shall, my lord.
1918 GUILDENSTERN.
1919 We will, my lord.
1975 Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
2186 Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
2187 into amazement and admiration.
2191 She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
2192 go to bed.
2195 My lord, you once did love me.
2197 Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
2198 do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
2199 you deny your griefs to your friend.
2201 How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
2202 himself for your succession in Denmark?
2270 The single and peculiar life is bound,
2271 With all the strength and armour of the mind,
2272 To keep itself from noyance; but much more
2273 That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
2274 The lives of many. The cease of majesty
2275 Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
2276 What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
2277 Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
2278 To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
2279 Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
2280 Each small annexment, petty consequence,
2281 Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
2282 Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
2286 GUILDENSTERN.
2287 We will haste us.
2642 What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
2644 Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
2645 And bear it to the chapel.
2647 Believe what?
2651 Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
2659 I understand you not, my lord.
2662 My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
2663 with us to the king.
2680 Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
2681 We cannot get from him.
2683 Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
2685 Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
2772 Wilt please you go, my lord?
