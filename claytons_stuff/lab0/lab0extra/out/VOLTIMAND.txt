1115 Most fair return of greetings and desires.
1116 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
1117 His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
1118 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
1119 But, better look'd into, he truly found
1120 It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
1121 That so his sickness, age and impotence
1122 Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
1123 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
1124 Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
1125 Makes vow before his uncle never more
1126 To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
1127 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
1128 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
1129 And his commission to employ those soldiers,
1130 So levied as before, against the Polack:
1131 With an entreaty, herein further shown,
1132 That it might please you to give quiet pass
1133 Through your dominions for this enterprise,
1134 On such regards of safety and allowance
1135 As therein are set down.
