Just had derived classes that wanted an argument have optioned constructor to take one. Still go back to base just have variable now. If not argument passed just defaults.

6)
Since XOR is a great encrpytion device basically client encrypts with a chain of XOR and server decrypts with same chain.

Trials:
server skipped every other decrypt operator

All showed failed decryptions. XOR is powerful :)
