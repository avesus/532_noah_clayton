1)
enque -> run_service has correct/good behaviour of adding the item,
then popping and printing it properly.
run_service -> enque causes the program to deadlock


2)
Since pop will be waiting at a condition variable released by the
notify in push (enque) the detached service thread will make progress
as it no longer impedes enque with its waiting. All values print
reliably seemingly without any races

3)
Nearly no difference in percieved performance. Possibly a bit lower
but generally got exact same results
